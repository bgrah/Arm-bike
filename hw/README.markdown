Arm-bike/hw
===========

TO-DO:
------
+ MCU PCB:
  - Put all pins on headers.
  - Improve design with separate analog and xtal ground.
  - Include mounting holes and round PCB edges.
  - Add schottky diodes on power input
  - Optimize header layout for multi-module layer use
+ SENSOR PCB:
  - Make place for GPS antenna
  - Leave free space for possible later additions (gyro,...)
+ TOUCHPAD PCB
  - Check MPR121 datasheet for touchpad dimensions/layout
  - Make space for LCD module
+ BIKE PCB
  - Design PWM enabled current supply for power LEDs
  - Battery powered with magnetic switch enable?
  - Voltage regulators from Vbat to 5V and 3.3V
+ LED holders
  - Sturdy, nice, water-resistant, easy to remove.
  - Good cooling
